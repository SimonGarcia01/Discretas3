For the Python section you will have to also present a written summary, in english, of how was your trend of thought to solve the exercise (one paragraph). This part will be marked taken into account the regex, the explanation and the number of cases passed. Each of these exercises must be solved using regular expressions, any other approach, even if it works, wonâ€™t be accepted.</font>\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"YKc2lA9GpDvY"},"source":["1) [15 pts] Find the regular expression for the language over $\\Sigma = \\{0,1,2\\}$ of all strings that only have one occurrence of three consecutive ones."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ta68FtGOpDva"},"source":["$$\\text{^(?:[02]|10|12|110|112)*111(?:[02]|10|12|110|112)*\\$}$$"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"zV5WyZWLpDvb"},"source":["2.
