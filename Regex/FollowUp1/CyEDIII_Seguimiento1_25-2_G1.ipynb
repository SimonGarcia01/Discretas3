    "# Regular Expressions in Python (Follow-up 1)\n",
    "<font size=\"3\">For this follow-up you must solve 2 exercises using the theoretical knowledge you have gathered in class and 3 more exercises using Python regular expressions. For the Python section you will have to also present a written summary, in english, of how was your trend of thought to solve the exercise (one paragraph). This part will be marked taken into account the regex, the explanation and the number of cases passed. Each of these exercises must be solved using regular expressions, any other approach, even if it works, wonâ€™t be accepted.</font>\n",

For HH since it must b between 00 and 23 I first made 3 groups 0[0-9], 1[0-9] and 2[0-3] but then I saw that those starting with 0 and 1 use the same ranges then I could combine them with the |. So then it could be 0 or 1 and then any number from 0-9 (\\d) --> [0-1]\\d. Then I just combined it with the starting number with 2's, so its [0-1]\\d|2[0-3] since it can only be one of those 2 groups. Then I grouped it with () so it could be called at the end, and since that is the first group captured, then I would call it using \\1 --> ([0-1]\\d|2[0-3]):MM:MM:\\1. Then I would need to do exactly the same with MM but this one can be summarized even further since 1,2,3,4,5 could be accompanied by any digit \\d and the five numbers can bet written in a range --> [0-5]\\d. Then I group it to get the second reference by using () and the \\2. Every part is separated by colons."
