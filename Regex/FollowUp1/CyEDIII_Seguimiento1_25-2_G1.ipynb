    "<font size=\"3\">For this follow-up you must solve 2 exercises using the theoretical knowledge you have gathered in class and 3 more exercises using Python regular expressions. For the Python section you will have to also present a written summary, in english, of how was your trend of thought to solve the exercise (one paragraph). This part will be marked taken into account the regex, the explanation and the number of cases passed. Each of these exercises must be solved using regular expressions, any other approach, even if it works, wonâ€™t be accepted.</font>\n",

    "Since I was looking for 3 words that go next to each other I knew I had to do ((\\b\\w+\\b) (\\b\\w+\\b) (\\b\\w+\\b)). This would get and consume those words so then, because they are grouped, then I can call them with \\b\\1\\b \\b\\2\\b \\b\\3\\b after a .* since any amount of words can be between those two triplets. That being said, this didn't work exactly because the pattern *consumed* the words it was matching. So as soon as the findall would catch the word, no other option could be found with those same words. This caused it to just get one triplet in every case. The two examples below (gracias profe) helped me to get the idea that I needed to check for the three words without consuming them so findall() would check for the patter over and over again. By doing (?=(\\b\\w+\\b \\b\\w+\\b \\b\\w+\\b)) and making it a look ahead, it will find at least one triplet, and add it to the findall list. The next step was to count the ocurrences of the triplets to filther those that actually happen more than twice. For that reason then I take the list of triplets withing the findall and then use count the ocurrence of each triplet, if its greater or equal o two, then it would get added to the repeated list. Then I just needed to do a for loop that traversed overy every list of words, make the words lowercase and pass each through the find all to finally print."

So then it could be 0 or 1 and then any number from 0-9 (\\d) --> [0-1]\\d. Then I just combined it with the starting number with 2's, so its [0-1]\\d|2[0-3] since it can only be one of those 2 groups. Then I grouped it with () so it could be called at the end, and since that is the first group captured, then I would call it using \\1 --> ([0-1]\\d|2[0-3]):MM:MM:\\1. Then I would need to do exactly the same with MM but this one can be summarized even further since 1,2,3,4,5 could be accompanied by any digit \\d and the five numbers can bet written in a range --> [0-5]\\d. Then I group it to get the second reference by using () and the \\2. Every part is separated by colons."
